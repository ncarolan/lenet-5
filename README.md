This repository implements the LeNet-5 model for handwritten digit recognition. The implementation is based on the model described in *"Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition"* (1998) by LeCun, Bottou, Bengio, and Haffner. 

Some architectural changes are made to the 1998 model to accomodate the different dimensions of the modern MNIST dataset. 

### Usage
The models can be trained in the [`lenet.ipynb`](lenet.ipynb) notebook.
